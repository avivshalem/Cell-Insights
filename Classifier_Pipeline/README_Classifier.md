# ML Classifier

## How to run using example data
1. Provided are numpy arrays with the data for classification, training and  inference
2. Make sure _example_data_ and _example_data_inference_ folders are with data

## Training with example data
1. Run _Train Classifier.py_
2. By default, the Neural Network Classifier wil be trained
3. Model and images of the training regime will be saved at '\Models_Classifier'' 
3. Enabling several Boolean over the _Train Classifier.py_ will allow the user to test several other ML methods for classification, such as Regression, Decision Trees, etc.

## Inference and ROC-AUC analysis with example data
1. Run _Inference ROC.py_ 
2. ROC-AUC plot is saved into the _example_data_inference_ directory
